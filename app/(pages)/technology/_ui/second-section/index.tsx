Unlike Elon Muskâ€™s Starlink which is used for broadband video and internet, our radio air-link is compatible with Narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) which was standardized in 3GPP Release 13 and is considered for 5G massive machine communication. We have published patents on how to make NB-IoT works over satellites.'
